-part 1 the setting for find files
if all the lhe file are in the different directorys, but all the directorys are in the same directory.

- part 2 setting mass check list 
How to use:
1. use "|" as delimiter 
2. use the name in the lhe file/param cards
(Ex:       4 0.000000e+00 # mc  -> so we choose # mc )
(the multiple compare list Ex: #mgr | # mb )

		*******************************************************************************************
		* if the file name looks like:(use "_" as delimeter) 													*
		* job_Zprime_A0h_A0chichi_MZp600_MA0300_slc6_amd64_gcc481_CMSSW_7_1_30_tarball.tar.xz.lhe	*
		*  1    2     3     4       5      6     7     8     9      10  ...								*
		* choose the mass compare place: 5 | 6   																	*
		* for the check (mzp | ma0) setting mass value 															*

- part 3 PDF weight check
	Ex: 123-456 | 555 (it will see weather the PDF id from 123 to 456 and 555 exist or not)

- part 4 root analysis 
		if not run root, mass width/ kinetic test/ mother and duaghter mass test/ won't be done.
	 	the ExRootConverter will run automatically. If you have already had the root file, please use the
		same name as the lhe file and put it in the same directory.
